# Evil Hangman
This project accepts text file input and creates a dictionary of words. These words act as all the words that can be used for reference by the Evil Hangman. The game will allow you to select the amount of letters in the word you would like to guess and then each guess you make the Evil Hangman algorithm sneakily changes the word so you never win. He is truly evil.
# Motivation
This project exists because it was an assignment for my CS 240 class. Though this exists because it was assigned, I learend many skills from working with a larger project of interconnecting pieces.

# Build Status
The current project is working and passes all test cases and plays the game until the end.

# Code Style
This project is written in Java.

# Tech Used
Built and tested inside of IntelliJ.
