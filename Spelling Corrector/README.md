# Spelling Corrector

This project accepts text file input and creates a dictionary of words. These words act as all the words that can be
used for spell checking. The user can input any word and the program will do its best to recommend a word for
replacement. The replacement word is based of which word has the closest edit distance, frequency, and similarity to the
input word.

# Motivation

This project exists because it was an assignment for my CS 240 class. Though this exists because it was assigned, I
learend many skills from working with a larger project of interconnecting pieces.

# Build Status

The current project builds completely and will offer you a recommended word if you input a incorrectly spelled word.

# Code Style

This project is written in Java.

# Tech Used

Built and tested inside of IntelliJ.
